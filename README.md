## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Waterfall Methodology
Overview
The Waterfall methodology is a linear, sequential approach where the project is divided into distinct phases. Each phase must be completed before moving on to the next, with no overlap or iteration between phases.

Phases
Requirements Gathering

System Design

Implementation

Integration and Testing

Deployment

Maintenance

Advantages
Clear Structure: The sequential nature makes it easy to understand and manage.

Documentation: Extensive documentation provides a clear record of development.

Predictability: With detailed planning upfront, timelines and costs can be accurately predicted.

Easy to Manage: Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements.

Disadvantages
Inflexibility: Difficulty in accommodating changes once a phase is completed.

Late Testing: Testing is done at the end, making it hard to fix issues that arise late.

Limited Client Interaction: Client feedback is typically not incorporated until the project is near completion.

Risk of Failure: High risk if initial requirements were not well understood.

Agile Methodology
Overview
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach that promotes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. The project is broken into small, manageable units called sprints, each delivering a potentially shippable product increment.

Principles
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.

Working software over comprehensive documentation.

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.

Responding to change over following a plan.

Advantages
Flexibility: Easily accommodates changes even late in the project.

Continuous Testing and Integration: Issues are identified and resolved quickly.

Customer Collaboration: Frequent feedback from stakeholders ensures the project meets their needs.

Improved Quality: Regular iterations and reviews lead to a higher quality product.

Disadvantages
